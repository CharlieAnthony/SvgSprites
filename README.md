The inspiration for this is being able to apply inline styling to svg graphics without having to inline the entire graphic to the DOM. Being able to display svg graphics inside of an img tag prevents easy styling via css on svg graphics, whilst inlining svg's bloats the DOM on larger projects. Svg sprites seem like a good compromise between the two, although I still need to investigate how widly supported this solution is.
